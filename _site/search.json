    "text": "7 Network Constrained Spatial Point Patterns Analysis 7.1 Overview Network constrained Spatial Point Patterns Analysis (NetSPAA) is a collection of spatial point patterns analysis methods special developed for analysing spatial point event occurs on or alongside network. The spatial point event can be locations of traffic accident or childcare centre for example. The network, on the other hand can be a road network or river network.\nIn this hands-on exercise, you are going to gain hands-on experience on using appropriate functions of spNetwork package:\nto derive network kernel density estimation (NKDE), and to perform network G-function and k-function analysis 7.2 The Data In this study, we will analyse the spatial distribution of childcare centre in Punggol planning area. For the purpose of this study, two geospatial data sets will be used. They are:\nPunggol_St, a line features geospatial data which store the road network within Punggol Planning Area. Punggol_CC, a point feature geospatial data which store the location of childcare centres within Punggol Planning Area. Both data sets are in ESRI shapefile format.\n7.3 Installing and launching the R packages In this hands-on exercise, four R packages will be used, they are:\nspNetwork, which provides functions to perform Spatial Point Patterns Analysis such as kernel density estimation (KDE) and K-function on network. It also can be used to build spatial matrices (‘listw’ objects like in ‘spdep’ package) to conduct any kind of traditional spatial analysis with spatial weights based on reticular distances. sf package provides functions to manage, processing, and manipulate Simple Features, a formal geospatial data standard that specifies a storage and access model of spatial geometries such as points, lines, and polygons. tmap which provides functions for plotting cartographic quality static point patterns maps or interactive maps by using leaflet API.\n\npacman::p_load(sf, spNetwork, tmap, tidyverse)\n\n7.4 Data Import and Preparation The code chunk below uses st_read() of sf package to important Punggol_St and Punggol_CC geospatial data sets into RStudio as sf data frames.\n\nnetwork &lt;- st_read(dsn=\"data/geospatial\", \n                   layer=\"Punggol_St\")\n\nReading layer `Punggol_St' from data source \n  `D:\\FuWanqian\\ISSS608-VAA\\Hands-on_Ex\\Hands-on_Ex03\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 2642 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: LINESTRING\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 34038.56 ymin: 40941.11 xmax: 38882.85 ymax: 44801.27\nProjected CRS: SVY21 / Singapore TM\n\n\n\nchildcare &lt;- st_read(dsn=\"data/geospatial\",\n                     layer=\"Punggol_CC\")\n\nReading layer `Punggol_CC' from data source \n  `D:\\FuWanqian\\ISSS608-VAA\\Hands-on_Ex\\Hands-on_Ex03\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 61 features and 1 field\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XYZ\nBounding box:  xmin: 34423.98 ymin: 41503.6 xmax: 37619.47 ymax: 44685.77\nz_range:       zmin: 0 zmax: 0\nProjected CRS: SVY21 / Singapore TM\n\n\n\nchildcare2=st_zm(childcare, drop = TRUE,\n        what = \"ZM\")\n\n\nchildcare\n\nSimple feature collection with 61 features and 1 field\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XYZ\nBounding box:  xmin: 34423.98 ymin: 41503.6 xmax: 37619.47 ymax: 44685.77\nz_range:       zmin: 0 zmax: 0\nProjected CRS: SVY21 / Singapore TM\nFirst 10 features:\n      Name                      geometry\n1   kml_10 POINT Z (36173.81 42550.33 0)\n2   kml_99 POINT Z (36479.56 42405.21 0)\n3  kml_100 POINT Z (36618.72 41989.13 0)\n4  kml_101 POINT Z (36285.37 42261.42 0)\n5  kml_122  POINT Z (35414.54 42625.1 0)\n6  kml_161 POINT Z (36545.16 42580.09 0)\n7  kml_172 POINT Z (35289.44 44083.57 0)\n8  kml_188 POINT Z (36520.56 42844.74 0)\n9  kml_205  POINT Z (36924.01 41503.6 0)\n10 kml_222 POINT Z (37141.76 42326.36 0)\n\n\n\nnetwork\n\nSimple feature collection with 2642 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: LINESTRING\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 34038.56 ymin: 40941.11 xmax: 38882.85 ymax: 44801.27\nProjected CRS: SVY21 / Singapore TM\nFirst 10 features:\n     LINK_ID                   ST_NAME                       geometry\n1  116130894                PUNGGOL RD LINESTRING (36546.89 44574....\n2  116130897 PONGGOL TWENTY-FOURTH AVE LINESTRING (36546.89 44574....\n3  116130901   PONGGOL SEVENTEENTH AVE LINESTRING (36012.73 44154....\n4  116130902   PONGGOL SEVENTEENTH AVE LINESTRING (36062.81 44197....\n5  116130907           PUNGGOL CENTRAL LINESTRING (36131.85 42755....\n6  116130908                PUNGGOL RD LINESTRING (36112.93 42752....\n7  116130909           PUNGGOL CENTRAL LINESTRING (36127.4 42744.5...\n8  116130910               PUNGGOL FLD LINESTRING (35994.98 42428....\n9  116130911               PUNGGOL FLD LINESTRING (35984.97 42407....\n10 116130912            EDGEFIELD PLNS LINESTRING (36200.87 42219....\n\n\n7.5 Visualising the Geospatial Data Before we jump into the analysis, it is a good practice to visualise the geospatial data. There are at least two ways to visualise the geospatial data. One way is by using plot() of Base R as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nplot(st_geometry(network))\nplot(childcare,add=T,col='red',pch = 19)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo visualise the geospatial data with high cartographic quality and interactive manner, the mapping function of tmap package can be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntmap_mode('view')\n\ntmap mode set to interactive viewing\n\ntm_shape(childcare) + \n  tm_dots() + \n  tm_shape(network) +\n  tm_lines()\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\n7.6 Network KDE (NKDE) Analysis In this section, we will perform NKDE analysis by using appropriate functions provided in spNetwork package.\n7.6.1 Preparing the lixels objects Before computing NKDE, the SpatialLines object need to be cut into lixels with a specified minimal distance. This task can be performed by using with lixelize_lines() of spNetwork as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nlixels &lt;- lixelize_lines(network, \n                         700, \n                         mindist = 375)\n\nWhat can we learned from the code chunk above:\nThe length of a lixel, lx_length is set to 700m, and The minimum length of a lixel, mindist is set to 350m. After cut, if the length of the final lixel is shorter than the minimum distance, then it is added to the previous lixel. If NULL, then mindist = maxdist/10. Also note that the segments that are already shorter than the minimum distance are not modified\n7.6.2 Generating line centre points Next, lines_center() of spNetwork will be used to generate a SpatialPointsDataFrame (i.e. samples) with line centre points as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nsamples &lt;- lines_center(lixels) \n\nThe points are located at center of the line based on the length of the line.\n7.6.3 Performing NKDE We are ready to computer the NKDE by using the code chunk below.\n\ndensities &lt;- nkde(network, \n                  events = childcare,\n                  w = rep(1, nrow(childcare)),\n                  samples = samples,\n                  kernel_name = \"quartic\",\n                  bw = 300, \n                  div= \"bw\", \n                  method = \"simple\", \n                  digits = 1, \n                  tol = 1,\n                  grid_shape = c(1,1), \n                  max_depth = 8,\n                  agg = 5, \n                  sparse = TRUE,\n                  verbose = FALSE)\n\n\ndensities &lt;- nkde(network, \n                  events = childcare2,\n                  w = rep(1, nrow(childcare2)),\n                  samples = samples,\n                  kernel_name = \"quartic\",\n                  bw = 300, \n                  div= \"bw\", \n                  method = \"simple\", \n                  digits = 1, \n                  tol = 1,\n                  grid_shape = c(1,1), \n                  max_depth = 8,\n                  agg = 5, \n                  sparse = TRUE,\n                  verbose = FALSE)\n\nWhat can we learn from the code chunk above?\nkernel_name argument indicates that quartic kernel is used. Are possible kernel methods supported by spNetwork are: triangle, gaussian, scaled gaussian, tricube, cosine ,triweight, epanechnikov or uniform. method argument indicates that simple method is used to calculate the NKDE. Currently, spNetwork support three popular methods, they are: method=“simple”. This first method was presented by Xie et al. (2008) and proposes an intuitive solution. The distances between events and sampling points are replaced by network distances, and the formula of the kernel is adapted to calculate the density over a linear unit instead of an areal unit. method=“discontinuous”. The method is proposed by Okabe et al (2008), which equally “divides” the mass density of an event at intersections of lixels. method=“continuous”. If the discontinuous method is unbiased, it leads to a discontinuous kernel function which is a bit counter-intuitive. Okabe et al (2008) proposed another version of the kernel, that divide the mass of the density at intersection but adjusts the density before the intersection to make the function continuous. The user guide of spNetwork package provide a comprehensive discussion of nkde(). You should read them at least once to have a basic understanding of the various parameters that can be used to calibrate the NKDE model.\n7.6.3.1 Visualising NKDE Before we can visualise the NKDE values, code chunk below will be used to insert the computed density values (i.e. densities) into samples and lixels objects as density field.\n\nsamples$density &lt;- densities\nlixels$density &lt;- densities\n\n\n# rescaling to help the mapping\nsamples$density &lt;- samples$density*1000\nlixels$density &lt;- lixels$density*1000\n\n\ntmap_mode('view')\n\ntmap mode set to interactive viewing\n\ntm_shape(lixels)+\n  tm_lines(col=\"density\")+\ntm_shape(childcare)+\n  tm_dots()\n\n\n\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\n\nkfun_childcare &lt;- kfunctions(network, \n                             childcare,\n                             start = 0, \n                             end = 1000, \n                             step = 50, \n                             width = 50, \n                             nsim = 50, \n                             resolution = 50,\n                             verbose = FALSE, \n                             conf_int = 0.05)\n\n\nkfun_childcare$plotk"
