8.1 Overview
In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to compute spatial weights using R. By the end to this hands-on exercise, you will be able to:

import geospatial data using appropriate function(s) of sf package,
import csv file using appropriate function of readr package,
perform relational join using appropriate join function of dplyr package,
compute spatial weights using appropriate functions of spdep package, and
calculate spatially lagged variables using appropriate functions of spdep package.
8.2 The Study Area and Data
Two data sets will be used in this hands-on exercise, they are:

Hunan county boundary layer. This is a geospatial data set in ESRI shapefile format.
Hunan_2012.csv: This csv file contains selected Hunanâ€™s local development indicators in 2012.
8.2.1 Getting Started
Before we get started, we need to ensure that spdep, sf, tmap and tidyverse packages of R are currently installed in your R.
